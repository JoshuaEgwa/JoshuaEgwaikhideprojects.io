I am a Computer Science student at Texas State University, cybersecurity intrigues me, the idea of defending data from attackers, creating dashboards to visualize and understand data more, and creating scripts to automate processes to me seems a lot more interesting than doing something like WebDev. Cybersecurity has so many pathways you can take, it's not one-dimensional. Right now I'm extremely interested in learning Threat intelligence incident response, and general cloud security. On this website, you can find all my projects, and I talk about them in full detail   



# Threat Intelligence Automation using Python

In this project, I used Python scripts to gather threat intelligence data from APIs. The APIs I used were VirusTotal, CIRCL, and AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal documents the detected URLs, the CIRCL API documents the DNS records, and the AbuseIPDB API documents the abuse score.

*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
